This repository contains the slide deck I created to pitch my [_**US Presidential Elections Vote Break-up**_](https://shahstewart.shinyapps.io/US_PresidentialElections/) app, that was created as a part of the course-work for course [_**Developing Data Products**_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products/home/welcome).

You can view this deck at: [**_shahstewart.github.io/slidifyDeck1/_**](https://shahstewart.github.io/slidifyDeck1/)
