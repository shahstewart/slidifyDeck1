This repository contains the slide deck I created to pitch my [_**US Presidential Elections Vote Break-up**_](https://shahstewart.shinyapps.io/US_PresidentialElections/) app, that was created as a part of the course-work for course [_**Developing Data Products**_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products/home/welcome).

You can view this deck at: [**_shahstewart.github.io/slidifyDeck1/_**](https://shahstewart.github.io/slidifyDeck1/)  

Though this deck was knitted using _slidify_, `slidify::github_publish` had issues reading git config, and could not publish files to _github.io_. The knitted html files were
added to _gh-pages_ branch manually.
